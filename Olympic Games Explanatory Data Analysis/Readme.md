## Olympic Games Explanatory Data Analysis

In this notebook I take upon the challenge of analyzing 3 different csv to answer and work on the different problems asked along the botebook.
I use mainly pandas with matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy. 

#### **Goals**

Practice Python Pandas to process and analyze dataset.

**Sections I go through. Functions and Method I apply:**

* Data import and Inspection
* Merging and Concatenating (rename, concat, merge....)
* Data Cleaning (groupby, dropna, map, loc, astype, index....)
* Answer specific questions (seaborn, heatmap, countplot, sort_values, crosstab, reindex, rank...)
* Statistical Analysis (scipy, corr, spearmanr, stats, p-value)
